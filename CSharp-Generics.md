# Chapter: C# Generics

## Introduction to Generics

Generics allow you to define classes, methods, delegates, and interfaces with a placeholder for the type of data they store or use. This provides type safety and efficiency by enabling code reuse with different data types without compromising performance.

## Benefits of Generics

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that data types are consistent.
- **Code Reusability**: Allows the same code to work with different data types.
- **Performance**: Reduces the need for boxing/unboxing and typecasting.

## Generic Types in C#

### Generic Classes

Generic classes allow you to define a class with a placeholder for the type of data it can store.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class GenericList<T>
{
    private T[] items;
    private int count;

    public GenericList(int size)
    {
        items = new T[size];
        count = 0;
    }

    public void Add(T item)
    {
        if (count < items.Length)
        {
            items[count++] = item;
        }
    }

    public T Get(int index)
    {
        if (index < count)
        {
            return items[index];
        }
        throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();
    }
}
```

### Generic Methods

Generic methods are methods with a placeholder for the data type, which allows them to be used with different data types.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Utilities
{
    public static void Swap<T>(ref T a, ref T b)
    {
        T temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
}
```

### Generic Interfaces

Generic interfaces define a contract that can be implemented by generic or non-generic types.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IRepository<T>
{
    void Add(T item);
    T Get(int id);
}
```

## Constraints on Generics

Constraints can be used to limit the types that can be used as arguments for a generic type.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class GenericClass<T> where T : IComparable
{
    public bool Compare(T x, T y)
    {
        return x.CompareTo(y) > 0;
    }
}
```

### Types of Constraints

- `where T : struct` - T must be a value type.
- `where T : class` - T must be a reference type.
- `where T : new()` - T must have a parameterless constructor.
- `where T : baseClass` - T must be or derive from a specific base class.
- `where T : interfaceName` - T must implement a specific interface.
- Multiple constraints can be applied to a single type parameter

### Chapter: C# Generics

#### Introduction to Generics

Generics in C# allow you to define classes, methods, delegates, and interfaces with a placeholder for the type they operate on. This provides a way to create reusable code and enhances type safety and performance. Generics were introduced in .NET Framework 2.0 and have since become an essential part of the C# language.

#### Benefits of Generics

1. **Type Safety**: Generics enforce type safety at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
2. **Performance**: They eliminate the need for boxing and unboxing, enhancing performance.
3. **Code Reusability**: Generics allow you to write a method or class that can work with any data type.
4. **Maintainability**: Generic code is more maintainable and easier to read and understand.

#### Defining Generic Classes

A generic class is defined with a type parameter. Here’s a basic example of a generic class:

```csharp
public class GenericClass<T>
{
    private T _value;

    public GenericClass(T value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public T GetValue()
    {
        return _value;
    }

    public void SetValue(T value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }
}
```

In this example, `T` is a type parameter that can be replaced with any type when an instance of the class is created.

#### Generic Methods

A generic method is defined with a type parameter. Here’s an example:

```csharp
public class GenericMethods
{
    public void Display<T>(T value)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(value);
    }
}
```

You can call this method with any type:

```csharp
GenericMethods gm = new GenericMethods();
gm.Display(123);    // Displays 123
gm.Display("Hello"); // Displays Hello
```

#### Constraints on Type Parameters

You can restrict the types that can be used as arguments for a type parameter by applying constraints. Here are some common constraints:

- **where T : struct**: T must be a value type.
- **where T : class**: T must be a reference type.
- **where T : new()**: T must have a parameterless constructor.
- **where T : <base class name>**: T must be or derive from the specified base class.
- **where T : <interface name>**: T must implement the specified interface.

Example with constraints:

```csharp
public class GenericClass<T> where T : new()
{
    private T _value = new T();
}
```

#### Generic Interfaces

Just like classes and methods, interfaces can also be generic:

```csharp
public interface IRepository<T>
{
    void Add(T item);
    T Get(int id);
}
```

A class implementing this interface:

```csharp
public class Repository<T> : IRepository<T>
{
    private List<T> _items = new List<T>();

    public void Add(T item)
    {
        _items.Add(item);
    }

    public T Get(int id)
    {
        return _items[id];
    }
}
```

#### Generic Delegates

Delegates can also be generic. Here’s an example:

```csharp
public delegate T Transformer<T>(T arg);

public class GenericDelegates
{
    public static int Square(int x) => x * x;
    public static void Example()
    {
        Transformer<int> square = Square;
        Console.WriteLine(square(5));  // Outputs 25
    }
}
```

#### Covariance and Contravariance

Generics in C# support covariance and contravariance in certain scenarios. Covariance allows you to use a more derived type than originally specified, while contravariance allows you to use a less derived type.

- **Covariance**: Applied to output parameters (e.g., return types).
- **Contravariance**: Applied to input parameters.

Example:

```csharp
public interface ICovariant<out T>
{
    T Get();
}

public interface IContravariant<in T>
{
    void Set(T value);
}
```

#### Conclusion

Generics are a powerful feature in C# that enhance type safety, performance, and code reusability. By understanding and utilizing generics, you can write more flexible and maintainable code. Whether you’re defining generic classes, methods, interfaces, or delegates, generics can help you create versatile and efficient solutions.
